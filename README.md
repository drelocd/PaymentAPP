# PaymentAPP
Web Payment APP For Job Applications
Hello guys, My name is Derrick and today we are going to create a simple job application WebApp that allows users to apply for a job after Paying a small Application Fee.
The WebApp uses PHP for server-side scripting and handling data while the Frontend part is mainly HTML and CSS.
The App utilizes the Mpesa-Api for payments

                                                                        APP LOGIC
   The user is Initially required to fill in all the form fields and hit Submit at the end of the Application
   The App verifies If the form data is valid first, then the Mpesa API is triggered.
   The API uses the input from telephone input field as the primary number (must be safaricom) to Push the STKpush function to that number
   The API handles the transaction and checks if it is successful or not
   If successful, the remaining User data from the Form is sent to a database for storage else the data is discarded and the user has to begin the Application afresh.
